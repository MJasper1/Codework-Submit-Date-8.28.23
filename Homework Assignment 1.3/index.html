    <p>
      What is the difference between a <span>block element</span> and an
      <span>inline element</span>?
    </p>

    <h2>Block Elements</h2>

    <p>
      A block level element takes up the full width of the webpage, and
      therefore always starts
    </p>
    on it's own row.

    <h3>Examples of block elements include:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>h1-h6: Headings from largest (h1) to smallest (h6)</li>
      <li>p: Paragraphs for text content</li>
      <li>div: A container for grouping elements</li>
      <li>ul:Unordered lists, which are by bulleted lists</li>
      <li>ol:Ordered lists, which are numbered lists</li>
      <li>li: A list item in an unordered or ordered list</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

    <p>
      An inline level element is only as wide as the content inside, and doesn't
      start a new row.
    </p>
    <h3>Examples of inline elements include:</h3>
    <a href="http:google.com">A link</a>
    <button type="button">A button</button>
